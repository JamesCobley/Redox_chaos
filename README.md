# Redox_chaos
Non-linear systems redox dynamics in the setting of cysteine redox proteoforms. 
# Source code 
1. Generating proteoforms
The [generate_proteoforms.jl](https://github.com/JamesCobley/Redox_chaos/blob/main/generate_proteoforms.jl) script generates the number of proteoforms for a given R value. Calculating the allowed and barred transition across the k-state range.
