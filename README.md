# Redox_chaos
Non-linear systems redox dynamics in the setting of [cysteine redox proteoforms](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bies.202200248). 

# Coding environment
The [Julia](https://julialang.org/)-based source code is configured to operate in a terminal environment after the [Redox_chaos](https://github.com/JamesCobley/Redox_chaos/blob/main/random.jl) repoitory has been cloned. 
# Source code 
1. Generating proteoforms
The [generate_proteoforms.jl](https://github.com/JamesCobley/Redox_chaos/blob/main/generate_proteoforms.jl) script generates the number of proteoforms for a given R value. Calculating the allowed and barred transition across the k-state range.
# Using the source code
Install [Julia](https://julialang.org/) and clone the [Redox_chaos](https://github.com/JamesCobley/Redox_Chaos) repository into your environment
